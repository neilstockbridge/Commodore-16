## Step 3

The stock capacitors `C7` (bypass for `U5`) and `C10` (bypass for `U8`) interfere with the mezzanine board.

Either replace the capacitors (100 &micro;F for `C10`, 220 &micro;F for `C7`) or desolder and re-mount them on the underside of the mainboard.


## Step 4

If you choose instead to save the original chips (16K x 4 DRAM `U5` and `U6` and 74LS257 `U7` and `U8`) then use desoldering braid to wick the solder from the vias.  Wiggling the pins while the solder is liquid helps to wick it out.  This approach permits fitting the sockets, re-inserting the original chips and testing one at a time to help identify which work is faulty if there is a problem.


## Step 9

Fit one end of the wire harness to the mezzanine board before inserting it into sockets `U7` and `U8`.

Check that the pins on the mezzanine board are straight prior to insertion.
